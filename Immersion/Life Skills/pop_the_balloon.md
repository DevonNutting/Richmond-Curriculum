# Lesson Plan: Pop the Balloon or Find Love - Identifying Healthy Relationship Traits

## **Duration:**
60 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
This lesson will use an engaging, interactive game inspired by *Pop the Balloon or Find Love* to help students identify the qualities of a healthy and compatible life partner. Students will also reflect on the traits they should cultivate in themselves to attract and maintain a strong, positive relationship. The activity will encourage self-awareness, critical thinking, and meaningful discussion about relationships.

## **Objectives:**
- Identify key traits of a healthy and compatible life partner.
- Reflect on the qualities one should develop to attract a healthy partner.
- Engage in critical thinking and discussion about compatibility and relationship values.

## **Materials:**
- Balloons (one per student)
- Small slips of paper
- Markers
- Whiteboard and markers
- List of discussion questions

## **Standards:**
- Social-Emotional Learning (SEL): Self-awareness and relationship skills
- Critical Thinking: Analyzing and evaluating traits of a compatible partner
- Communication: Engaging in meaningful discussions and debates

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Introduce the lesson and discuss the importance of identifying compatible traits in a partner.
   - Begin with an open-ended question: *What are the most important qualities in a life partner?* (List answers on the board.)
   - Explain that today’s activity will help them determine what traits align with a healthy relationship and what traits might indicate incompatibility.

### 2. **Direct Instruction (10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Provide foundational knowledge on traits that contribute to healthy relationships.
   - Discuss research-based characteristics of a strong relationship, such as mutual respect, emotional support, shared values, and communication.
   - Introduce the concept of "deal-breakers" and "green flags" in relationships.

### 3. **Guided Practice (20 minutes) - Pop the Balloon Activity**
   - **Objective:** Encourage students to critically evaluate and prioritize relationship traits through an interactive game.
   - Each student receives a balloon and a slip of paper.
   - On the paper, they write one key trait they believe is *essential* in a partner.
   - Alternatively, create your own traits or 'profiles' to put in each balloon.
   - The slips are randomly shuffled and placed inside the balloons before inflating them.
   - Students then form a circle and take turns popping a balloon.
   - When a balloon is popped, the student reads the trait aloud and, as a group, they decide if it’s a "green flag" (valuable trait) or if it would be a deal-breaker in a relationship.
   - If the trait is a deal-breaker, the group discusses why and what the opposite (healthy) trait would be.

### 4. **Independent Practice (10 minutes) - Self-Reflection**
   - **Objective:** Encourage personal growth by identifying qualities to develop in oneself.
   - Students individually reflect and write answers to:
     - *What traits do I currently have that make me a good partner?*
     - *What traits do I need to work on to attract and maintain a strong relationship?*
   - Pair-and-share with a partner to discuss takeaways from the activity.

### 5. **Closure (10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Reinforce key takeaways and encourage continuous self-improvement.
   - Lead a group discussion: *What surprised you during this activity? Did your views on relationships change?*
   - Emphasize that relationships require continuous effort and self-growth.
   - Encourage students to think critically about the kind of people they want to surround themselves with in all aspects of life.

## **Assessment:**
- Participation in the balloon activity and discussion.
- Thoughtfulness in self-reflection responses.
- Engagement in the closing discussion.

## **Extra Activities:**
- Create a "Green Flag & Red Flag" chart for display in the classroom.
- Research a famous couple and analyze why their relationship works (or why it didn’t).

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
- Which traits did students value the most? Were there any surprises?
- Did the activity encourage self-awareness and personal development?
- How did students engage in discussions about healthy relationships?
